Question 5


Overview:

Here's how I would go about identifying the cause and improving performance step by step.

1. Step One: Diagnose What’s Slowing Us Down

Before making any changes, we need to understand what’s causing the slowness. Here are some tools I’d use:

- Google PageSpeed Insights – Gives us a quick overview and practical suggestions.
- GTmetrix – Helpful for visualizing load times, identifying large files, and seeing waterfall breakdowns.
- WebPageTest.org – Great for measuring things like Time to First Byte (TTFB).
- Chrome DevTools (Network tab) – Lets us analyze which files take longest to load.


With these tools, I’d look for:
- Large or uncompressed images
- Too many or large JavaScript/CSS files
- Server response time issues
- Inefficient plugins or database queries

2. Step Two: Apply Optimizations


A. Optimize Images
- Convert images to WebP or compress them using TinyPNG, ShortPixel, or an image optimizer plugin.
- Enable lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) to delay loading images until needed.

B. Minify & Defer Scripts
- Use plugins like WP Rocket to minify CSS and JS.
- Defer or async-load non-critical scripts so they don’t block page rendering.

C. Caching for Speed
- Use a caching plugin:
  - Free: W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache
  - Premium: WP Rocket
- Enable:
  - Page caching – Speeds up page delivery
  - Browser caching – Reduces repeat load times
  - GZIP compression – Shrinks files for faster transfer

D. Clean Up the Database

  -Use WP-Optimize to spam comments or spam data, to optimize tables
  -Schedule this cleanup weekly to keep things tidy.

E. Upgrade Hosting & PHP

Use modern PHP (8.1+), which is faster and more secure.

If we’re on shared hosting, consider moving to a faster host like SiteGround.

Enable object caching (e.g., Redis or Memcached) if supported by the host.

3. Use a CDN for media files such as images or videos
  We can use cloudflare wich offers 10GB free tier storage
 
  -Sign up at cloudflare.com
  -Add your domain and update your DNS to use Cloudflare's nameservers
  -Enable Caching: Cache static assets (images, CSS, JS)
  -Enable Auto Minify: Minify HTML, CSS, and JS
  -Enable Brotli Compression: Improves performance over GZIP
  -Use Cloudflare's free SSL and firewall features for added performance and security
